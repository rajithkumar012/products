# Product Management Application (Backend)

This is the backend for the Product Management application built using Django and Django Rest Framework. It provides the API to manage products, including adding, updating, viewing, and deleting products.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Django 4.x
- Django Rest Framework

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd product_management
2. Install Dependencies
pip install django djangorestframework
3. Create and Apply Migrations
Run the following commands to create and apply the database migrations:
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
4. Run the Development Server
To start the Django development server, use the following command:
python manage.py runserver
The server will start running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

5. API Endpoints
The API endpoints provided by this application are:

GET /api/products/: List all products.
POST /api/products/: Add a new product.
PUT /api/products/<id>/: Update an existing product by its ID.
DELETE /api/products/<id>/: Delete a product by its ID.
6. API Testing
You can test the API using tools like Postman or cURL. All data should be sent and received in JSON format.

Example to create a product using cURL:
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Product 1", "description": "A sample product", "price": 19.99}'

2. Install Dependencies
Install the required packages using npm (or yarn):
npm install
3. Update Backend URL (Optional)
If your backend is running on a different URL or port (other than http://localhost:8000), update the Axios base URL in ProductForm.js and ProductList.js.

For example:

javascript
Copy code
axios.post('http://your-backend-url/api/products/', product);
